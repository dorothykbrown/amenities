For this simple application I created separate classes for the CashRegister, Product and Rules. 

The CashRegister class would contain the method to calculate the total price (applying the rules belonging to a cash register instance) of the items in a given basket so long as the items are valid products that belong to the CashRegister instance. 

The Product and Rule classes would allow new products and rules to be easily added by creating new instances of each and adding them to a CashRegister instance. With a database, these classes would be models
